## What is
Execute cross chain juicebox contributions.
WARNING: This is nowhere near production grade, it's a simple showcase.

## Why is
@Marco from @ottodao (https://juicebox.money/@ottodao) asked wether we could help with xchain funding.

## How to
1. Create `.env` with `PK=<your private key>`
2. Possibly uncomment tx sending - watch out it's kinda expensive since it targets mainnet.
3. Run `deno run main.ts --project-id <your_project_id>`
